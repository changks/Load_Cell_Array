# Load_Cell_Array
R functions to process data from load cell array

I design and validated load cell array to monitor changes of pot weight.
The processed dataset can be used to represent dynammics of irrigation, biomass and nutrient comsumption.

R functions in processing data from load cell array:

(1) LC_QAQC_GapFilling.R
(2) LC_Pull_Out_Data_Every_10M30M1H2H3H.R
(3) LC_Pull_Out_Data_Day_Night_1M.R
(4) LC_Diff.R
(5) LC_Linear_Analysis_nlme_lmList.R
